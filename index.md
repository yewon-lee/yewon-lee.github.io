## About Me

I am a first year M.Sc. student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I am advised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) at the [Robot Vision and Learning Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/#/), which is affiliated with the [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/). I am gratefully funded by the [NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship (Master's)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp) and the [DeepMind Fellowship](https://www.deepmind.com/education).

My current research interest is in task and motion planning (TAMP). Prior to this, I worked with Prof. Shkurti on contrastive learning for imitation learning and numerical methods for partial differential equations with Profs. [David Zingg](http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/) and [Masayuki Yano](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/ace/). I spent 8 months working on sensor fusion algorithms at Epson's robotics Research and Development team during my Professional Experience Year. I completed my B.A.Sc. in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) from the University of Toronto with High Honours.
