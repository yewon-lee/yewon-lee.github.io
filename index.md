## About Me

I am a first year M.Sc. student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I am gratefully advised by [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) at the [Robot Vision and Learning Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/#/), which is affiliated with the [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/) and [Vector Institute for AI](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I am grateful to be a receipient of the [NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship (Master's)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp).

I am currently researching task and motion planning using differentiable simulation. Previously, I worked with Florian on contrastive learning for imitation learning for my undergraduate thesis. Prior to that, I researched numerical solvers for partial differential simulation under Profs. [David Zingg](http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/) and [Masayuki Yano](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/ace/). I have also spent 8 months working on learning-based sensor fusion at Epson's robotics research and development team during my Professional Experience Year.
