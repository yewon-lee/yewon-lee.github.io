## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science (CIS) at the [GRASP Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am advised by Prof. [Rachel Holladay](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rhollada/). My research interest centers around decision making, planning, and control for robot manipulation, particularly in contact-rich, long horizon settings. 

I obtained my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I was advised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) and collaborated with Prof. [Fabio Ramos](https://fabioramos.github.io/Home.html). For my Master's thesis, I developed a differentiable algorithm for task and motion planning that makes use of gradients from physics simulation. Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) at the University of Toronto. During this time, I interned at Epson's Robotics R&D team researching computer vision algorithms for robotic manipulation.

I am gratefully supported by the [NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship - Doctoral](https://nserc-crsng.canada.ca/en/funding-opportunity/canada-graduate-research-scholarship-doctoral-program), and have been honored to receive the [Google DeepMind Fellowship](https://www.deepmind.com/education), [NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship (Master's)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp), and [Ontario Graduate Scholarship](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019245.html) for my Master's studies.
