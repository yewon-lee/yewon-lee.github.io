## About Me

I am a second year research-stream M.Sc. student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, advised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) at the [Robot Vision and Learning Lab (RVL)](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/#/), (affilitations: [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/)). I am gratefully funded by the [Ontario Graduate Scholarship](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019245.html), the [NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship (Master's)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp), and the [DeepMind Fellowship](https://www.deepmind.com/education).

My research interest centeres around probabilistic algorithms for robot manipulation, specifically task and motion planning (TAMP). I am also very interested in the applications of differentiable physics simulators for robotics. Prior to pursuing my M.Sc., I conducted research on robot perception at RVL and Epson's robotics Research and Development team. My first exposure to research was with Profs. [David Zingg](http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/dwz/) and [Masayuki Yano](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/ace/), where I worked on high-order numerical methods for partial differential equations.
