## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington. I am advised by Prof. [Siddhartha Srinivasa](https://goodrobot.ai/) at the [Personal Robotics Lab](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/). My research interests center around learning for robot manipulation, particularly in long-horizon settings and around humans. 

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I was advised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) at the [Robot Vision and Learning Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/#/) and collaborated with Prof. [Fabio Ramos](https://fabioramos.github.io/Home.html) at NVIDIA. My Master's thesis was on differentiable task and motion planning (TAMP). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) at the University of Toronto. During my undergrad, I interned at Epson's Robotics R&D team researching computer vision algorithms for robot manipulation.

I have been honored to receive the [Google DeepMind Fellowship](https://www.deepmind.com/education), [NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship (Master's)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp), and [Ontario Graduate Scholarship](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019245.html) for graduate studies.
