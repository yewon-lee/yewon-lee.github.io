## About Me

I am a second year research-stream M.Sc. student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) at the [Robot Vision and Learning Lab (RVL)](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/#/). I am interested in task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotics, grapsing, robot learning, and differentiable physics simulators. For my M.Sc. thesis, I am working on developing a differentiable TAMP algorithm using probabilistic inference and differentiable physics. My work is gratefully funded by the [Google DeepMind Fellowship](https://www.deepmind.com/education), [NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship (Master's)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp), and [Ontario Graduate Scholarship](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019245.html).

Prior to starting my M.Sc., I completed my B.A.Sc. in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/) from the  University of Toronto with a major in Aerospace Engineering and double minors in Robotics and AI. During this time, I also interned at Epson's robotics R&D team where I worked on computer vision algorithms.
